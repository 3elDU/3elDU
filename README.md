# About me

Hi there and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Zakhar, pronounced ZA as in ZARA, KH as in Khan and AR as in Arizona (the short is just Zak). I also go by the nicknames _3elDU_ and _petafloppa_.<br>
I am a self-taught Web Developer, occasionally dropping into embedded or game development.

# Projects

- [bamboo](https://github.com/3elDU/bamboo) - A top-down survival game heavily inspired by minecraft, written in Go. I started this project when learning Go.
- [rss-reader](https://github.com/3elDU/rss-reader) - RSS aggregator app written in Flutter with the [backend](https://github.com/3elDU/rss-reader-backend) in Go
- [cell-simulation](https://cells.petafloppa.cc) - Cellular automata simulating evolution by natural selection. Each cell is like a small autonomous computer having it's set of instructions. The original version was written in C, then rewritten in Rust, and you're looking at the final version written in TypeScript and using Vue for the UI.
- [nixos-config](https://github.com/3elDU/nixos-config) - My NixOS configuration. I don't use NixOS right now (until my autism strikes again)
- (no repository yet) - A personal PDA project, aiming to create a hackable and portable device with an E-Ink screen and a keyboard ([Palm](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)>) vibes). It is based on [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/). The kernel is written in C, using FreeRTOS, and all the userspace is programmed in Lua. In the project's current stage, I have the Lua interpreter working, display and sd card driver written, the font drawn, the only thing remaining is gluing all of that together. The display I have on hand is not E-Ink, it's a crappy 3.2" resistive touch panel. And I don't have a 3D printer nearby to hack on a case, so this project is kinda stale for now :(
- [spdl](https://github.com/3elDU/spdl) - Short for **SP**otify **D**own**L**oader. An alternative frontend for spotify written in Vue and based on Electron. We don't actually stream any audio from spotify, instead we search for the same track on YouTube. Supports streaming and downloading.
